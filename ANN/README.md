# Customer Churn Prediction and Salary Estimation Using ANN

## Overview
This repository contains an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model designed to predict customer churn in a banking context. The model identifies whether a bank customer is likely to leave (churn) based on various features. Additionally, the repository includes a regression model to estimate customer salaries using a similar ANN approach.

## The main components of this repository include:
1. Churn_Modelling.csv: Contains the data used for both the churn prediction and salary estimation models.
2. Churn_modelling.ipynb: ANN model implemented for churn prediction.
3. Churn_Prediction.ipynb: Script to make predictions using the trained models.
4. Churn_hyperparametertuning.ipynb: Hyperparameter tuning Scripts for optimizing model performance.
5. app.py: A user-friendly streamlit web application to interact with the models.
6. Preprocessing Files: Pickle files for encoders and scaler used during data preprocessing.
7. Churn_Regressionmodel: ANN model implemented for Regression problems on the same dataset.
